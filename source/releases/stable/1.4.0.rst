Synfig 1.4.0 Release Notes
############################

Synfig Studio 1.4.0 is a major stable release, which is introducing many new features and improvements. Please read below for details.

Animation Tools
===============

Editable curves in Graphs Panel
-------------------------------

Now curves in Graphs Panel have control points, and you can drag to
change curve shape. Multiple selection for waypoints is also available.
You can also use arrow keys on keyboard to move points. Double-click on
a curve creates a new waypoint, Ctrl+A/Ctrl+D shortcuts are
selecting/deselecting all points. Much thanks to Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes for implementing this!

Sound synchronization features
------------------------------

We did a major cleanup of code responsible for sound playback, fixed
non-working volume parameter and eliminated synchronization issues.

In addition to that, Rodolfo Ribeiro Gomes implemented a special panel to display waveform. Now it's so easy to sync your animation with soundtrack!

Animation Baking
----------------

Now you can "bake" animation of any parameter! This operation "burns"
any interpolated curve as a sequence of waypoints.

Open images in external tool
----------------------------

Ankit Kumar Dwivedi implemented a possibility to open images in external
editor. Right now it is possible to configure preferred image editor via
relevant option in Preferences. After that you can right-click any Image
Layer and choose "Edit image in external tool...".

|image5|

|image6|

Fixes and changes for onion-skin functionality
----------------------------------------------

Onion-skin functionality was mainly broken since version 1.2.0 - it
wasn't able to display more than one onion-skin layer. Now this ability
is restored. At the same time, we have changed functionality of
onion-skin: in all previous versions it was linked to keyframes only,
now it is set relatively to ordinary frames. We plan to continue
improving onion-skin features as part of `issue
#600 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/600>`__.

|image7|

Importing
==============

Simple import of image sequences
--------------------------------

Now it is easy to import image sequences - just choose "File" -> "Import
sequence..." from menu.

|image8|

Vectorization of bitmap images
------------------------------

Synfig Studio now allows to convert raster (bitmap) image into vector
image constructed from outlines. The vectorization algorithm is ported
from OpenToonz animation software by Ankit Kumar Dwivedi, as part of
Google Summer of Code 2019 program.

Basic video import functionality
--------------------------------

This version introduces basic functionality for importing video files.
At the current state the system is still too slow to work with large AVI
and MP4 videos, but it is already possible to play with small animated
GIFs (yes, it can import GIF as well).

Rendering and Export
====================

Export animation for web (Lottie)
---------------------------------

Synfig Studio can export animations to `Lottie JSON
format <https://airbnb.design/lottie/>`__, which allows to embed them
into web pages, play them natively in web browser and on mobile
platforms. This format is also
`used <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/704#issuecomment-508974632>`__
for creating Telegram’s animated stickers! This feature is implemented
by Anish Gulati as part of Google Summer of Code 2019 program.

    <br><br>

Default render settings
-----------------------

Default rendering settings now configured to use AVI format with popular
mpeg4 codec by default, which resolves issues with playback on most
systems (`issue #464 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/464>`__).

|image9|

Still, if you wish to achieve best quality, consider to choose
"H.264 (Lossless)" codec option.

|image10|

Other notable changes regarding rendering process:

-  Changing rendering target now automatically changes extension of
   output file.
-  Rendering status is now indicated with a progress bar at Info Panel
   (issues `#383 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/383>`__,
   `#626 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/626>`__).
-  A sound notification is played when rendering is done (`issue
   #648 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/648>`__).

Render engine improvements
--------------------------

Render engine got some major optimizations, which greatly reduces time
of handling scenes with many layers, comparing to version 1.2.2 (see
`issue #314 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/314>`__).

In this version following layers got special optimizations: Outline Layer
(completely rewritten), Region Layer, Checkerboard Layer, SuperSample
Layer.

Also, render engine now has downsampling algorithm for bitmaps,
which greatly improves quality resulting image.

"Preview" rendering mode for workarea
-------------------------------------

Downsampling algorithm for images (mentioned above) greatly improves
quality if your scene uses big images scaled to smaller size.
Unfortunately, this operation demands additional CPU resources and you
will notice general application slowdown when working with such scenes.

There is an option to enable Draft rendering mode (it disables
downsampling), but this solution doesn't fits for all cases, as it is
hides many layers, which could be important for you.

So, we added one
more display mode for workarea - "Preview" - which displays all possible
layers, but with some simplifications - i.e. no downsampling,
approximations for blur algorithms and some other simplifications.
"Preview" mode is giving a fair compromise between speed and display
quality and is used by default in GUI. For more details please check
`this discussion <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/729>`__.

|image13|

Workarea Cache and Background Rendering
---------------------------------------

Synfig now remembers already rendered frames, which is greatly improves
experience of playback and timeline scrubbing.

Also, now it is possible
to have background rendering of all frames in current animation. This
allows to achieve very smooth playback and timeline scrub. You can
enable background rendering using a relevant button on toolbar (see
second video below).

    <br><br>	

Gamma handling
--------------

Since the very beginning of its development, Synfig was handling all
color calculations with Gamma value set to 2.2. As result, there were a
lot of issues with color interpolation and blending, like `this
one <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/933>`__. 

We decided, that
it is good moment to get rid of this behavior and changed how Gamma
handled in Synfig. The tricky part here was to keep compatibility with
old files. Here's what we did:

-  Gamma is now defined on per-document basis (in previous versions it
   was an application-wide setting). So, now every document has its own
   gamma value defined. You can see/change Gamma value by selecting
   "Canvas" -> "Properties" from menu and switching to "Gamma
   correction" tab.
-  For all newly created documents Gamma is set to 1.0.
-  Old documents (from previous versions) are opened with Gamma set to
   2.2, so you won't notice changes (although you will still notice same
   artifacts from old version, like the one noted
   `here <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/933>`__). You can
   manually set Gamma to 1.0, to get rid of those issues, but this will
   change the look colors would look in your animation.

So, with this change users should not notice any change when working
with their old documents. Still you can encounter an issue, when copying
layers from old files to new (and vice versa) - the colors of copied
layers appear different in destination document. This can be easily
fixed manually `as described
here <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/1022#issuecomment-571449482>`__.

Layers
======

Advanced Outline Layer
----------------------

Advanced Outline Layer was completely rewritten and optimized in this
version. Also, it is now capable to display two new types of tips -
"Off-Peak Stop" and "Inner Rounded Stop", that can be used to define
outline start/end for dashes.

|image15|

With this addition you can
easily do effects like shown here (`source
file <http://www.synfig.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/adv-outline-1.4.0.sifz>`__):

|image16|

Switch Layer
------------

Now it is possible to select visible layer by index in Switch Layer.
This is done using a new parameter - "Active Layer Depth". The parameter
takes effect when "Active Layer name" parameter is empty.

|image17|

Rectangle Layer
---------------

Rectangle Layer now capable to have two types of rounded corners and
horizontal/vertical feather. Users with a deep knowledge of Synfig know,
that those features were available in Filled Rectangle Layer (not the
same as Rectangle Layer), which was a part of Example layers. Now all
those features are merged into standard Rectangle Layer, and the Filled
Rectangle Layer is removed. See GitHub's `issue
#745 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/745>`__ for details.

|image18|

|image19|  

Settings & Customization
========================

Saving workspace layouts
------------------------

Now it is possible to save your workspace layout - just choose
"Workspace" - "Save workspace" from menu. Also you can edit list of
custom workspaces by calling "Workspace" - "Edit workspace list...".

|image20|

Default background for new files
--------------------------------

Now it is possible to set default background for newly created documents
(`issue #636 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/636>`__). The
background can be a solid color or image. You can configure this via
“Edit” -> “Preferences” -> “Document”.

|image21|

Other notable improvements
==========================

-  Improved process of creating Splines and Polygons: now it is possible
   to finish shape creation with double-click or by hitting Enter. Also
   you can click first vertex of Spline to loop and finish shape
   creation.
-  Now it is possible to remove Layers by hitting Delete key.
-  Tab placement crosses now hidden by default and revealed only when
   user starts dragging some panel. See `issue
   #238 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/238>`__ for details.
-  Now it is possible to change animation length directly from workarea
   (see `issue #684 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/684>`__).
-  Double-clicking waypoint in Timetrack panel shows Waypoint Properties
   dialog.
-  Now it is possible to configure color of transparent areas in Preview
   Window (`issue
   #636 <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/636>`__).
-  Workarea now has a widget to change length of timeline.
-  Brush Tool is now disabled by default. User can get it back by
   enabling "Experimental features" option in Preference.
-  Home/End keys now set time cursor to start/end of timeline.
