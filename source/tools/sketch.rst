The ``Sketch Tool`` allows you to draw freehand over the top of a
|Canvas|.

Each workarea has a single sketch overlay associated with it.

Sketches are not saved as part of the **.sifz** file when you save your
work, but can be saved separately as **.sketch** files for later
reloading.

The Sketch Tool has the following in its |Tool_Options_Panel| :

-  **Show Sketch**: a checkbox for toggling the visibility of the sketch
   overlay **On** and **Off**.
-  **Undo Last Stroke**: cancels the most recent edit to the sketch
   overlay. Can be repeatedly clicked to cancel more edits.
-  **Clear Sketch**: clears the current workarea's sketch overlay.
-  **Save Sketch As...**: writes the sketch overlay from the current
   workarea to a .sketch file.
-  **Open a Sketch**: loads a previously saved .sketch file, overwriting
   any previously drawn or opened sketch in the current workarea.

| Sketch uses the color of the default ``foreground color`` in the
  |Toolbox|.
