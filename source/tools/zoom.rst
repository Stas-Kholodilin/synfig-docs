Description
-----------

The Zoom Tool allows you to move closer to, or further away from,
objects that are being edited in the working area. Note that the Zoom
Tool does not affect the output render as described in the |render_options|.

.. _tool_zoom  Usage:

Usage
-----

Click on the Zoom Tool button to activate. Now try the following:

-  Click anywhere in the working area: it will zoom to 125% of the
   current level. The zoom will be centered such that the point clicked
   on remains in the same position.
-  ``CTRL`` + click anywhere in the working area: it will zoom to 80% of
   the current level. (Notice that 80% of 125 is 100, so zooming in one
   step and out one step will leave you back at the original zoom
   level).
-  Click at any place and drag to create a rectangle: it will zoom to
   fit the rectangle in the current working window.
-  Click at any place and drag to create a rectangle, holding ``CTRL``
   as you release the mouse button: it will zoom out to fit the current
   working window in the rectangle.

Alternatively you can always use the existing |Mouse_Shortcuts| for that task (``CTRL`` + mouse wheel) or the
zoom buttons at the left bottom corners of the working area.
